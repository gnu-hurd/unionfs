While using unionfs, you could experience more permission errors or 
difficult or impossible file or directory deletion. This is a list of
things that can happen.

WARNINGS:

- If the translator is run as by an unpriviledged user, other users will fail
to create files or directory, since the translator won't be able to change
the ownership of the file.


PROBLEMS:

- If there's a name conflict in underlying filesystems between directories 
and files -- say that "foo" is a directory in underlying filesystem "a" while
is a file in the underlying filesystem "b" -- then unionfs will be unable to
delete this entry. This is a structural BUG (there's no clean way to solve it),
and should be fixed.

- If there's a name conflict in underlying filesystems between directories
(or between files), and the user has not permission to delete _ALL_ the 
entries -- e.g. one hidden entry is read-only -- then he will get an EPERM
even if permissions seems ok. This is a structural BUG (there's no clean way
to solve it), and should be fixed.
