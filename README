This is an `unionfs' translator for the Hurd. It is simple, but it is 
definitely not a joke.

It works by keeping in memory a dynamically updated tree of nodes, each 
node representing a directory in the unionfs. A node contains an array 
of ports that give access to the corrisponding directory in the underlying
filesystems.

On lookup, the first entry found is chosen. Thus, it is very important the
underlying filesystems ordering, since the first underlying filesystem will
be the first one to be searched during lookups, and it is the filesystem
where new files and directories are written into.

At the moment, underlying filesystem ordering is set by option ordering.

See CAVEAT for other unexpected behaviour that could happen.

The unionfs translator was originally written by Moritz Schulte 
<moritz@duesseldorf.ccc.de> and currently mantained by Gianluca Guida 
<glguida@gmail.com>.
